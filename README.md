Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between a car's attributes and its price to build a predictive model. The objective is to use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a used car based on various factors like the car’s age, mileage, make, fuel type, etc.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including:

Car model
Year of manufacture
Mileage (in kilometers)
Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
Engine size (in liters)
Transmission type (Manual, Automatic)
Number of previous owners
Car condition
Seller type (Dealer or Private)
Price (target variable)
You can access the dataset here (replace this with the actual link to your dataset).

Features
Independent Variables (Features):
Model: The car's make and model.
Year: Year of manufacture.
Mileage: Total kilometers driven.
Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, etc.).
Transmission: Manual or automatic transmission.
Engine_Size: The size of the car's engine.
Seller_Type: Whether the car is being sold by a dealer or a private individual.
Number_of_Owners: The number of previous owners.
Car_Condition: Condition of the car (Good, Fair, Poor).
Dependent Variable (Target):
Price: The selling price of the car.
Installation
To run this project locally, please ensure that you have Python installed. Then, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd used-car-price-prediction
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Modeling Process
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, categorical encoding (using one-hot encoding or label encoding), and feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the relationships between different features and car prices using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
Model Selection: Tried various machine learning algorithms such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Model Training: Split the data into training and test sets. Trained the models using cross-validation to evaluate performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics like:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Results
Best model: Random Forest Regressor (or the model you selected)
R² Score: 0.92
Mean Squared Error: 2800
Mean Absolute Error: 1200
These results indicate that the model is able to predict used car prices with a high degree of accuracy.

Future Improvements
More Features: Include additional features such as car brand reputation, safety ratings, or maintenance costs to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Improvement: Experiment with deep learning models like neural networks to further refine the predictions.
More Data: Collect more data to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.
