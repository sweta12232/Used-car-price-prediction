## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between a car's attributes and its price to build a predictive model. The objective is to use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a used car based on various factors like the carâ€™s age, mileage, make, fuel type, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including the following features:

| Unnamed: 0 | Name                             | Location   | Year | Kilometers Driven | Fuel Type | Transmission | Owner Type | Mileage    | Engine | Power    | Seats | Price |
|------------|----------------------------------|------------|------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| 0          | Maruti Wagon R LXI CNG           | Mumbai     | 2010 | 72000             | CNG       | Manual       | First      | 26.6 km/kg | 998 CC | 58.16 bhp | 5.0   | 1.75  |
| 1          | Hyundai Creta 1.6 CRDi SX Option | Pune       | 2015 | 41000             | Diesel    | Manual       | First      | 19.67 kmpl | 1582 CC| 126.2 bhp | 5.0   | 12.50 |
| 2          | Honda Jazz V                     | Chennai    | 2011 | 46000             | Petrol    | Manual       | First      | 18.2 kmpl  | 1199 CC| 88.7 bhp  | 5.0   | 4.50  |
| 3          | Maruti Ertiga VDI                | Chennai    | 2012 | 87000             | Diesel    | Manual       | First      | 20.77 kmpl | 1248 CC| 88.76 bhp | 7.0   | 6.00  |
| 4          | Audi A4 New 2.0 TDI Multitronic  | Coimbatore | 2013 | 40670             | Diesel    | Automatic    | Second     | 15.2 kmpl  | 1968 CC| 140.8 bhp | 5.0   | 17.74 |

The dataset includes the following features for each car:
- `Name`: The car's make and model.
- `Location`: City where the car is being sold.
- `Year`: Year of manufacture.
- `Kilometers_Driven`: Total kilometers driven.
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used (CNG, Diesel, Petrol).
- `Transmission`: Manual or automatic transmission.
- `Owner_Type`: Whether the car is first-hand, second-hand, etc.
- `Mileage`: Mileage in km/kg or kmpl.
- `Engine`: Engine displacement in cubic centimeters (CC).
- `Power`: Power output of the car in brake horsepower (bhp).
- `Seats`: Number of seats in the car.
- `Price`: The selling price of the car (target variable).

## Features

### Independent Variables (Features):
- `Name`: The car's make and model.
- `Location`: The city where the car is sold.
- `Year`: Year of manufacture.
- `Kilometers_Driven`: Total kilometers driven.
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used (CNG, Diesel, Petrol).
- `Transmission`: Manual or automatic transmission.
- `Owner_Type`: First-hand or second-hand ownership.
- `Mileage`: Car's mileage in km/kg or kmpl.
- `Engine`: Engine displacement in cubic centimeters (CC).
- `Power`: Engine power in brake horsepower (bhp).
- `Seats`: Number of seats in the car.

### Dependent Variable (Target):
- `Price`: The selling price of the car.

## Installation

To run this project locally, please ensure that you have Python installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sweta12232/used-car-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd used-car-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Modeling Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, perform categorical encoding (using one-hot encoding or label encoding), and apply feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the relationships between different features and car prices using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
3. **Model Selection**: Tried Linear Regression machine learning algorithms
4. **Model Training**: Split the data into training and test sets. Trained the models using cross-validation to evaluate performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics like:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R-squared

## Results

- Best model: `Random Forest Regressor` (or the model you selected)
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.82
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.1331

These results indicate that the model can predict used car prices with a high degree of accuracy.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Improvement**: Experiment with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
